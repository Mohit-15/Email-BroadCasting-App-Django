"Email-Broadcasting-App-Django" 

I have created a user authentication system for registering and signing in. I have created two models,
one for email list and the other one for messages.

Firstly user logged in and add the emails to the list, then write the message which user wants to send to the list of emails
and it automatically fetch the list from backend and send the message.
